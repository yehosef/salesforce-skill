# ShellCheck configuration for Salesforce Skill scripts
#
# This file configures shellcheck for the project.
# See: https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Directive

# Disable specific checks that are too strict for our use case

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
disable=SC1090

# SC1091: Not following sourced file
disable=SC1091

# SC2034: Variable appears unused (we use many variables for clarity)
# disable=SC2034

# SC2154: Variable referenced but not assigned (often from sourced files)
disable=SC2154

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# This is a style choice - we prefer combined declarations for readability
disable=SC2155

# Enable additional optional checks
enable=avoid-nullary-conditions
enable=quote-safe-variables
enable=require-variable-braces
